## Technologies Used

This website has been built almost completely in TypeScript with the following frameworks.

1. [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org), with [PWA](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) functionality.
2. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), for styling.
3. [Neobrutalism UI](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/), a component library based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

While we could build the same project with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, we chose development comfort over function. Moreover, the PWA functionality allows users to install the app for offline use and ease of access.
